Your Ball Simulator is now ready for web deployment! Here's what has been set up:

## ✅ What's Ready

1. **Web Build System**: Pygbag configuration for WebAssembly deployment
2. **GitHub Actions**: Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages on push to main
3. **Build Scripts**: Easy local building with `./build.sh`
4. **Package Configuration**: Ready for PyPI publication
5. **Multi-platform Support**: Works on web, desktop, and mobile browsers

## 🌐 Deployment Options
