# Ball Simulator - Interactive Physics Demo

ðŸŽ® **[Play Live Demo](https://advayc.github.io/ball-simulator/)**

This is a real-time physics simulation of a bouncing ball with dynamic rainbow colors and synchronized audio segments that play on collision.

## Features
- **Real-time physics simulation** with gravity and collision detection
- **Dynamic rainbow color cycling** that changes continuously
- **Audio segments** that play sequentially on each collision (0.2s segments from UNITY song)
- **Ball growth mechanics** - ball grows on collision until reaching maximum size
- **Continuous demo mode** - automatically resets for endless entertainment
- **Web-optimized** - runs directly in your browser using WebAssembly

## How it Works
- The simulation runs automatically in your browser
- Each collision with boundaries plays the next 0.2-second segment of the UNITY song
- The ball changes colors in a smooth rainbow cycle
- When the ball reaches maximum size, it automatically resets for continuous play
- Built with Python/Pygame and compiled to WebAssembly using pygbag

## Controls
No controls needed - just watch the mesmerizing physics simulation!

## Technical Details
- Built with pygame and compiled for web using pygbag
- WebAssembly-powered for native performance in browsers
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- Real-time audio processing and playback synchronization
